"Why do some busses only show the next two bus stops?"
"The data is retrieved directly from the Föli servers. If the app only shows the next two stops it is because Föli does not provide more accurate information for that bus."
"Why can I not get notifications when the app is closed?"
"In order to accurately determine where your bus is, the app loads data from the Föli servers several times a minute. If you close the app, it is not possible to check that often anymore and the data would be inaccurate."
